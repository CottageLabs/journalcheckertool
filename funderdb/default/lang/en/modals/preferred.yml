title: Preferred Route to OA
body: "<p>The Version of Record (VoR) is different from the Author Accepted Manuscript (AAM). The AAM is the
      version accepted for publication, including all changes made during peer review. The VoR contains all
      the changes from the copyediting process, journal formatting/branding etc., but it is also the version
      maintained and curated by the publisher, who has the responsibility to ensure that any corrections or
      retractions are applied in a timely and consistent way.</p>
      <p>For these reasons, the preferred option is to ensure that the VoR is made Open Access. Where the VoR
      can be made available in accordance with the Plan S principles, and there is a cost, many cOAlition S
      Organisations make funding available to cover these costs.</p>"
