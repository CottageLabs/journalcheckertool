title: Transformative journals
body: "<p>A <em>Transformative Journal</em> is a subscription/hybrid journal that is committed to transitioning
      to a fully OA journal. It must gradually increase the share of OA content and offset subscription
      income from payments for publishing services (to avoid double payments).</p>
