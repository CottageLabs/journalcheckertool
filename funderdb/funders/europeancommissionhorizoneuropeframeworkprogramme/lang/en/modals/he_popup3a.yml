body: "<p>Hybrid journals sell subscriptions and offer the option of making individual articles openly accessible with payment.</p>
      <p>Only publishing fees in full open access venues for peer-reviewed scientific publications are eligible costs under Horizon Europe.</p>
      <p>If you choose the open access option to be compliant, you must find alternative funds to pay the Article Processing Charges.</p>
      <p>If you cannot locate alternative funds, you can comply by publishing under the subscription model and self-archiving your article.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, you will have to select another publishing venue for your article such as 
      <a href=\"https://open-research-europe.ec.europa.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Research Europe</a>, the European 
      Commission's open access publishing platform.</p>
