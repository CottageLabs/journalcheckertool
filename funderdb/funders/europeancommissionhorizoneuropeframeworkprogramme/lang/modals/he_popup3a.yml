      <p>Only publication fees in full open access venues for peer-reviewed scientific publications are eligible costs under Horizon Europe.</p>
      <p>You must find alternative funds to pay the publishing costs, including open access Article Processing Charges, to be compliant.</p>
      <p>If you cannot locate alternative funds, you can comply by publishing under the subscription model and self-archiving your article.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, you will have to select another publishing venue for your article such as 
      <a href=\"https://open-research-europe.ec.europa.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Research Europe</a>, the European 
      Commission's open access publishing platform.</p>
