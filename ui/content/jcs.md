The Journal Comparison Service provides JCT with a list of available journals and the time periods for which price data is made available.  Here we provide a download of all journals from the Journal Comparison Service which have *current* price data (this does not include journals which have historical data but have not uploaded price data for the current reporting year).

Note that the download does not contain the actual price data.  For that you must have an account on the <a href="https://journalcomparisonservice.org">Journal Comparison Service</a>.

The JCT Price Data Providers can be obtained from [this CSV](/data/jcs_price_data.csv).

The format of the CSV is straightforward:

* ISSN - The ISSN of the journal.  The Journal Comparison Service only provides a single ISSN, and does not differentiate between Print and Online.
* Journal Title - The journal title according to the publisher when reporting the data to JCS
* Publisher - The publisher who uploaded the data to JCS 
* Years available - a comma separated, ordered list of the years for which data is available
