# List of publishers/journals that provide price and serice data to the Journal Comparison Service


The Journal Comparison Service (JCS) provides the Journal
Checker Tool (JCT) with a list of journals, and the time
periods for which price data is made available, that share price
and service data through the JCS.

Here we provide a download of all journals from the Journal Comparison Service which have *current* price data.

Note that the download does not contain the actual price data.  For that you must have an account on the <a href="https://journalcomparisonservice.org">Journal Comparison Service</a>.

The list of publishers/journals that provide price and service
data to the JCS can be obtained
from [this CSV](/data/jcs_price_data.csv).

The format of the CSV is as follows:

* ISSN - The ISSN of the journal.  The Journal Comparison Service only provides a single ISSN, and does not differentiate between Print and Online.
* Journal Title - The journal title according to the publisher when reporting the data to JCS
* Publisher - The name of the publisher who uploaded the data to JCS 
* Years available - a comma separated, ordered list of the years for which data is available
