This release introduces new capabilities for the Journal and Institution autosuggests.  The previous version used a simple search algorithm over the data sourced from a number of external datasources.  This new version is still sourced from those same external datasources, but that data has now been heavily processed and normalised in the JCT to provide an optimised search experience.  Searches over that data are now designed to prioritise results in a more useful manner, and we are in a better position to further enhance the data and the search experience going forward.

This change only affects the autosuggest boxes on the front page of the JCT application.  Compliance calculations and the API are unaffected.
