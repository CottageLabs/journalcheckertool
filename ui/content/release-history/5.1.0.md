There are a small number of journals which publish research articles as fully OA, but which do not meet the criteria for inclusion into the DOAJ.

This release introduces an additional datasource and an update to the JCT algorithm to determine the OA status of a journal to reflect that those journals are compliant.

Journals which fit into this category will now appear as Fully Open Access, and where caveats to that status apply these will be presented to the user in their results.
